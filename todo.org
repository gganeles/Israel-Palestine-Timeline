change the language of titles, but keeps originalTitle available for articcles

For updates, some cron job which prioritizes new over old, fail early to save
subrequests if possible maybe alternative to KV due to small free limit, pi?
speed/storage choice here, maybe chunnk each key to 1 week and further narrow,
wouldn't be too slow to filter

*** wikipedia YYYY in Israel, Palestine, etc
looks to be a pretty standardized format. Older years have a specific heading
for Israel Palestine Conflict, which is nice for historical events that have few
news articles otherwise. Other events may need workers AI, to filter, but I'm
leaning away from it because enforcing JSON is difficult.

* /api
** /events?date=[DATE]
Cached with lifespan as function of duration in past, so newer events get
regenerated automatically more.
** /flag?id=[ID]&type=[TYPE]&content?=[CONTENT]
Marks event with ID with type of flag.
- [ ] trigger update
